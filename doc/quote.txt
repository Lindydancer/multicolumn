"I [..] am
rarely happier
then when
spending an
entire day
programming my
computer to
perform
automatically a
task that it
would otherwise
take me a good
ten seconds to
do by hand. Ten
seconds, I tell
myself, is ten
seconds.  Time
is valuable and
ten seconds'
worth of it is
well worth the
investment of a
day's happy
activity
working out a
way to save
it".

/ Douglas Adams
