;;; Commentary:

;; Commands helpful when using multiple side-by-side windows.

;; Overview:
;;
;; Using multiple side-by-side windows is a great way to utilize the
;; large high-resolution displays that exists today. This package
;; provides the "missing features" of Emacs to create a side-by-side
;; layout, to navigate efficiently, and to manage the windows.
;;
;; This package is especially useful in conjunction with Follow mode,
;; a package provided with Emacs that create the illusion that several
;; windows showing the same buffer form a very tall virtual window.
;; For example, I use six side-by-side windows spread out across two
;; monitors, which lets me see 888 consecutive lines of code.
;; Concretely, this allows me to see all of the code in this package
;; at once.

;; Example:
;;
;; In the screenshots below, a text is being edited which is narrower
;; but taller than the Emacs frame.
;;
;; ![Image of Emacs with one window](doc/demo1.png)
;;
;; With `multicolumn-delete-other-windows-and-split-with-follow-mode'
;; four equally spaced side-by-side windows are created and Follow mode
;; is enabled, which makes it possible to see the entire text at once.
;;
;; ![Image of Emacs with four side-by-side windows](doc/demo2.png)

;; Supported Emacs Versions:
;;
;; This package is primarily for Emacs 24.4. However, with the help of
;; the companion package [old-emacs-support][1] it can be used with
;; earlier Emacs versions, at least from Emacs 22.
;;
;; [1]: https://github.com/Lindydancer/old-emacs-support

;; Usage:
;;
;; Place the source file in a directory in the load path. Add the
;; following lines to an appropriate init file:
;;
;;    (require 'multicolumn)

;; Creating side-by-side windows:
;;
;; * `C-x 4 3' (`multicolumn-delete-other-windows-and-split') creates
;; a number of side-by-side windows. The number of windows it creates
;; depends on the width of the frame and on `multicolumn-min-width'.
;; With a numerical argument, create this many windows.
;;
;; * `multicolumn-delete-other-windows-and-split-with-follow-mode'
;; does the same and enables Follow mode, so that one buffer takes
;; over where the previous buffer ends. This gives you an
;; unprecedented overview of the buffer.
;;
;; * `C-x 4 u' (`multicolumn-pop-window-configuration') restored the
;; previous windows layout.

;; Resizing the frame:
;;
;; * `multicolumn-resize-frame' resized and repositions the frame
;; to accommodate side-by-side windows of a specific width. You can
;; use this as an alternative to using a full-screen mode.
;;
;; * `multicolumn-resize-and-split-frame' resizes and positions
;; the frame and creates a number of side-by-side windows. This
;; function can be called from to suitable init file to ensure that a
;; number of side-by-side windows are created when Emacs is started.

;; Navigation:
;;
;; * `C-M-<' (`multicolumn-select-first-window') and `C-M->'
;; (`multicolumn-select-last-window') select the leftmost and rightmost
;; window, respectively.
;;
;; * `C-x 4 p' (`multicolumn-select-previous-window') selects the
;; previous windows. This package does not provide a function to
;; select the next. However, it binds `C-x 4 n' to `other-window'.

;; Window content management:
;;
;; * `C-x 4 t' (`multicolumn-transpose-windows') swaps the content of
;; the current and the next window.
;;
;; * `C-x 4 <' (`multicolumn-extend-left') and `C-x 4 >'
;; (`multicolumn-extend-right') displays the current buffer in the
;; previous and next windows, respectively.
;;
;; * `multicolumn-collect-windows' ensures that all windows displaying
;; the same buffer becomes adjacent.

;; Trackpad support:
;;
;; * `C-wheel-left' and `C-wheel-right' selects the next and previous
;; window using `multicolumn-trackpad-select-previous-window' and
;; `multicolumn-trackpad-select-next-window', respectively.
;;
;; * `M-wheel-left' and `M-wheel-right' selects the first and last
;; window using `multicolumn-trackpad-select-first-window' and
;; `multicolumn-trackpad-select-last-window', respectively.

;; Configuration:
;;
;; Unfortunately, it's hard from within Emacs to find out information
;; about the environment outside Emacs, for example a window manager
;; may reserve parts of the screen. This package tries to contains
;; information for as many systems as possible, however, you may need
;; configure this package to match yor system.
;;
;; See variable is the source code for how to configure this package.

;; Windows Notes:
;;
;; Width of multiple monitor display:
;;
;; The functions `display-pixel-width' and `display-pixel-height'
;; functions only return the dimentions of the primary monitor, in
;; some Emacs versions. To make this package use the full display, you
;; can do something like:
;;
;;     (defun my-display-pixel-width ()
;;       ;; The full width of the display
;;       3200)
;;
;;     (setq multicolumn-display-pixel-width-function
;;           'my-display-pixel-width)

;; OS X Notes:
;;
;; In newer Emacs version, you can set `ns-auto-hide-menu-bar' to t to
;; utilize more of the display.
;;
;; In OS X 10.9, each monitor is a separate space. If you want to
;; stretch an Emacs frame across multiple monitors, you can change
;; this in "System Preferences -> Mission Control -> Displays have
;; separate Spaces".
;;
;; The latest official release for OS X (as of this writing), 24.3,
;; does not support horizontal mouse event. However, it will be
;; included in the next release.

;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Resize and position frame.
;;

;; It's somehwat of black magic to find out exactly how large an Emacs
;; frame is allowed to be on a specific system. The functions below
;; are written to include as much information as possible. However, it
;; is not unlikely that you would need to override one of the
;; `...-function' variables and write your own function.

;; Note: `set-frame-size' takes the "text" area, i.e. without the one
;; set of fringes, scroll bars, and two frame borders. However, on
;; some systems the tool-bar is included in the text are, in some it's
;; not.
;;
;; Same as `frame-pixel-width':
;;
;; (let ((res 0))
;;   (dolist (w (window-list))
;;     (setq res (+ (window-width w t)
;;                  (frame-scroll-bar-width)
;;                  (frame-fringe-width)
;;                  res)))
;;   (+ res (* 2 (frame-border-width))))

;; The following facts appears to be impossible to find out:
;;
;; * The display area available to use (e.g. if the system has a menu).
;;
;; * The height of the menu bar, in pixels.
;;
;; * The height of the tool bar, in pixels.
;;
;; * If the tool bar is included in the text height of a frame.

;; Trackpad (horizontal mouse wheel) support.
;;

;;
;; When a swipe is performed, the following occurs:
;;
;; * A number of wheel-XXX events are emitted. They keep on coming
;;   even after the trackpad has been released in a kind of slowdown
;;   effect. Each event is numbered with a "click-count", starting
;;   from 1 and increasing.
;;
;; * If the qualifier key is released (or pressed), the remaining
;;   events will be associated with the new qualifier. The effect is
;;   that they may cause another function to be called! By default,
;;   there is no binding for wheel-xxx for most of the combinations of
;;   qualifiers, causing Emacs to "bing" a lot.
;;
;; * Sometimes, two wheel-XXX events may be intertwined, e.g. wheel-up
;;   and wheel-right. In that case, the "click-count" will restart
;;   from 1 each time.
;;
;; * Events can be marked as "click" (i.e. single), "double", and
;;   "tripple" (presumably, to be analogous with mouse click events).
;;   Unlike other qualifiers, you don't bind, say, `tripple-wheel-up'
;;   to a function, instead you bind `wheel-up' and check if `tripple'
;;   is present using `event-modifiers'.
